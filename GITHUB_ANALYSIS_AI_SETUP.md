# GitHub Analysis with Gemini AI - Setup Guide

## Overview
The GitHub Analysis feature now uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp** AI to provide intelligent insights about candidates based on their resume data and GitHub profiles.

## What's New

### ‚ú® AI-Powered Insights
Instead of just showing raw GitHub statistics, the system now:
1. Fetches GitHub profile data (repos, stars, projects)
2. Combines it with resume/profile data
3. Sends everything to Gemini AI for analysis
4. Displays comprehensive AI-generated insights including:
   - Overall Assessment
   - Key Strengths
   - Technical Expertise Analysis
   - Project Quality Evaluation
   - Growth Potential
   - Red Flags / Areas for Investigation
   - Recommended Interview Focus Areas
   - Hiring Recommendation

### üîò Button Always Visible
- The "üîç Analyse GitHub" button now shows for **all candidates**
- Even without a GitHub username, AI can analyze resume data
- If GitHub data is available, it enriches the analysis

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure the API Key

**Option A: Direct Configuration (Quick)**

Edit `DEVANGSHU_FRONTEND/COMPANY_MAIN_PAGE/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  window.ENV = {
    API_BASE_URL: 'http://localhost:5000/api',
    GEMINI_API_KEY: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE', // Paste your key here
    API_KEY: ''
  };
</script>
```

**Option B: Environment Variables (Production)**

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

Then modify the script to read from environment:

```javascript
window.ENV = {
  GEMINI_API_KEY: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY || 'fallback_key'
};
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python3 api.py

# Frontend
# Open DEVANGSHU_FRONTEND/COMPANY_MAIN_PAGE/index.html in browser
```

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User clicks "üîç Analyse GitHub" button** for any candidate
2. **System fetches GitHub data** (if username available):
   - Public repositories count
   - Stars, forks, followers
   - Top 3 projects with details
   - Languages used
3. **System builds comprehensive profile**:
   - Resume data (education, experience, skills)
   - GitHub statistics
   - Project details
4. **Gemini AI analyzes the profile**:
   - Evaluates technical expertise
   - Assesses project quality
   - Identifies strengths and concerns
   - Provides hiring recommendation
5. **Results displayed in modal**:
   - GitHub statistics (if available)
   - AI-generated insights
   - Top projects with links

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to get AI insights"

**Cause:** Gemini API key not configured or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Check API key in `index.html`
2. Verify key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
3. Check browser console for detailed error

### Issue: "GitHub data not available"

**Cause:** GitHub username not in resume or invalid

**Solution:**
- Analysis still works without GitHub data
- AI provides insights based on resume alone
- Ensure resumes include GitHub usernames if needed

### Issue: Button doesn't appear

**Cause:** Browser cache or JavaScript error

**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify script.js is loaded

### Issue: API rate limit exceeded

**Cause:** Too many Gemini API calls

**Solution:**
- Free tier: 15 requests per minute
- Paid tier: Higher limits
- Wait a minute and try again

## Cost Considerations

### Gemini 2.0 Flash Pricing (as of 2024)
- **Free Tier:** 15 RPM, 1 million tokens/day
- **Paid Tier:** $0.075 per 1M input tokens, $0.30 per 1M output tokens

### Estimated Costs
- Per analysis: ~$0.001 - $0.003
- 1000 analyses: ~$1-3
- Very cost-effective for hiring use case
