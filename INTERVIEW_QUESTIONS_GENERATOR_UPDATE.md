- Copy and Download buttons appear

### 4. Features Available

---

## Example Generated Questions

For a candidate with **React, Node.js, MongoDB** skills:

**Technical Questions:**
```
Q1: Could you describe the architecture of the front-end (React)
    and back-end (Node.js) components? How did you handle state
    management in React?

Q2: What considerations did you take into account when choosing
    MongoDB as the database? What challenges did you face?

Q3: In your real-time chat application, what were the primary
    benefits of using GraphQL compared to REST?

Q4: What specific TypeScript features were particularly helpful
    in your projects?
```

**Behavioral Questions:**
```
Q5: Describe a time you faced a significant technical challenge.
    What steps did you take to resolve it?

Q6: How do you stay up-to-date with the latest trends in software
    development?

Q7: Tell me about a time when you had to work with conflicting
    requirements.
```

**Real-World Scenarios:**
```
Q8: Imagine you're building an e-commerce platform for high-traffic
    like Amazon. How would you adapt your architecture?

Q9: How would you ensure data consistency in a real-time collaboration
    tool for distributed teams?
```

## API Integration

### Endpoint Used
```
POST /api/interview/generate
```

### Request Format
```json
{
  "candidate_name": "Ananya Sharma",
  "candidate_profile": "CANDIDATE PROFILE\nName: Ananya Sharma\nEducation: B.Tech in CS from IIT Bombay\nCGPA: 9.2/10\n..."
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "candidate_name": "Ananya Sharma",
  "interview_questions": "Full text with questions...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T07:15:07.287364"
}
```

### Parsing Logic
The frontend intelligently parses the AI response:
1. Splits by line breaks and question marks
2. Identifies numbered questions (1., 2., Q1:, etc.)
3. Cleans formatting (removes numbers, bullets)
4. Filters out headers and short lines
5. Displays as formatted question list

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Generator Section Not Showing
**Solution:** Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Button Not Responding
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check `GEMINI_API_KEY` in backend `.env`

### Issue: Questions Not Generating
**Solution:**
- Check backend logs: `tail -f backend/api_server.log`
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check network tab in browser DevTools
- Look for rate limit errors (max 5 requests/minute)

### Issue: Questions Are Generic
**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen with Gemini AI
- Check that candidate has skills/experience data
- Verify profile data is being sent (check Network tab)
- Try clicking "Show Details" first to ensure data loaded
